Do Batch Processing of the attached csv file to correct and standardise the spelling and grammar in the occupation column.

The context of the data is occupations listed in the 1901 Irish Census, by descending frequency.

The file will have a header and 2 columns. Keep the original columns in place, and the ordering of the file intact. Do not sort the file.

I have attached the script you previously created to do corrections to the occupation column.

The Script was created using the following instructions about how to process the occupation column.

First remove any brackets, handle '-' as whitespace, then condense duplicate whitespace.

Next fix the spelling and grammar according to British English, make sure apostrophes are added where appropriate, standardise the word ordering, and expand abbreviations. Where words can be combined, e.g. House Keeper to Housekeeper, please do so.

Use the script to process the occupation column of the csv file.

Store the results of your corrections in a 3rd column called "corrected_occupation".

For each batch, process the next 500 lines. Process them in two stages.

In the first stage, apply the script.

In the second stage, assess the results. Add any additional British English spelling, grammar, and ordering corrections you can identify to the script, then reprocess the batch for the final result. Do not remove any existing corrections.
