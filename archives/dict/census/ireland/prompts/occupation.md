Do Batch Processing of the attached csv file to correct and standardise the spelling and grammar in the occupation column.

The context of the data is occupations listed in the 1901 Irish Census, by descending frequency.

The file will have a header and 2 columns. Keep the original columns in place, and the ordering of the file intact. Do not sort the file.

This is how I want you to process the occupation column.

First remove any brackets, handle '-' as whitespace, then condense duplicate whitespace.

Next fix the spelling and grammar according to British English, make sure apostrophes are added where appropriate, standardise the word ordering, and expand abbreviations. Where words can be combined, e.g. House Keeper to Housekeeper, please do so.

Store the results of your corrections in a 3rd column called "corrected_occupation".

Please return the resulting csv file to me in batches of exactly 300 lines.

I have attached a script you already created to do this.

Please start from batch 7. do the batches one at a time. review batch 7 for word ordering and spelling.
