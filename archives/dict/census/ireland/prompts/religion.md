Take this CSV file,


Firstly on any row where the second column equals "GEMINI", spell check the first column against all known religions and Christian Denominations, then replace "GEMINI" with the result. Rows that do not have "GEMINI" can be used as an example result. For any row that you are not certain of, use "CHATGPT_UNKNOWN" as a replacement.


Next, use the identified religions/denominations in the amended second column to create additional "Classification", "Orientation", "Theology" and "Polity" columns


Finally give me the results back in a csv
